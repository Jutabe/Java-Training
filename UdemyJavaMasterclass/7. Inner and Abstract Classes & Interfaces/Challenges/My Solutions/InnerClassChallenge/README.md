## Challenge content

Modify the playlist challenge so that the Album class uses an inner class.
Instead of using an ArrayList to hold its tracks, it will use an inner class called SongList
The inner SongList class will use an ArrayList and will provide a method to add a song.
It will also provide findSong() methods which will be used by the containing Album class
to add songs to the playlist.
Neither the Song class or the Main class should be changed.
