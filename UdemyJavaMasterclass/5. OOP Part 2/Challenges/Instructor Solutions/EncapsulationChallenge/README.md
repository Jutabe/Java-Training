## Challenge content

Create a class and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques.

The class will be called Printer.

It will simulate a real Computer Printer.

It should have fields for the toner Level, number of pages printed and whether it is a duplex printer (capable of printing on both sides of the paper).

Add methods to fill up the toner (up to a maximum of 100%), another method to simulate printing a page (which should increase the number of pages printed).

Decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you think should be included.
